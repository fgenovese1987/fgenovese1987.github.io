I am a postdoctoral researcher in [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra) based in Belgium since May 2017. I currently work in the Fundamental Mathematics research group at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/) under the supervision of [Wendy Lowen](https://win.uantwerpen.be/~wlowen/); formerly, I was a member of the Algebra research group at the [University of Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/) under the supervision of [Michel Van den Bergh](http://hardy.uhasselt.be/personal/vdbergh/Members/michel_id.html).

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Mathematics at the [University of Pavia](https://web.unipv.it/), where I also defended my PhD thesis [*Quasi-functors as lifts of Fourier-Mukai functors: the uniqueness problem*](https://fgenovese1987.github.io/documents/thesis_phd.pdf) in December 2015, under the supervision of [Alberto Canonaco](http://www-dimat.unipv.it/canonaco/).

I am an alumnus of [Collegio Fratelli Cairoli](https://www.collegiocairoli.it/).

## Research interests (in short)
- Higher categorical enhancements of triangulated categories: differential graded categories, A-infinity categories.
- t-structures on triangulated categories and their enhancements.
- Applications of higher categories to algebraic geometry: derived categories, Fourier-Mukai functors.

## More personal data
- My [curriculum vitae](https://fgenovese1987.github.io/documents/cv_eng.pdf).
