I am not in academia anymore, but I will likely still update this page with mathematical projects I will be (on and off) working on. I still enjoy doing and talking about mathematics, so feel free to contact me at the listed email (remove the CAPITAL LETTERS to obtain it) for any questions or comments connected to my research.

Until January 2024 I was a researcher in [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra) working in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.matematica.unimi.it/) at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/) under the supervision of [Paolo Stellari](https://sites.unimi.it/stellari/). Until December 2022, I worked in the [Department of Algebra](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/faculty/organizational-structure/department?code=301) at the [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/uken-1.html) under the supervision of [Jan Šťovíček](https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~stovicek/). Before, I worked in the Fundamental Mathematics research group at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/) under the supervision of [Wendy Lowen](https://win.uantwerpen.be/~wlowen/welcome.html); formerly, I was a member of the Algebra research group at the [University of Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/) under the supervision of [Michel Van den Bergh](http://hardy.uhasselt.be/personal/vdbergh/Members/michel_id.html).

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Mathematics at the [University of Pavia](https://web.unipv.it/), where I also defended my PhD thesis [*Quasi-functors as lifts of Fourier-Mukai functors: the uniqueness problem*](https://fgenovese1987.github.io/documents/thesis_phd.pdf) in December 2015, under the supervision of [Alberto Canonaco](http://www-dimat.unipv.it/canonaco/).

I am an alumnus of [Collegio Fratelli Cairoli](https://www.collegiocairoli.it/).

## Research interests (in short)
- Higher categorical enhancements of triangulated categories: differential graded categories, A-infinity categories.
- t-structures on triangulated categories and their enhancements.
- Applications of higher categories to algebraic geometry: derived categories, Fourier-Mukai functors.
