## About me

I am a postdoc researcher in [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra) at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/). I've been working on the FWO Research Project *Hochschild cohomology and deformation theory of triangulated categories*, with promotors [Wendy Lowen](https://win.uantwerpen.be/~wlowen/) and [Michel Van den Bergh](http://hardy.uhasselt.be/personal/vdbergh/Members/michel_id.html).

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Mathematics at the [University of Pavia](https://unipv.it/), and there I also defended my PhD thesis [*Quasi-functors as lifts of Fourier-Mukai functors: the uniqueness problem*](https://fgenovese1987.github.io/documents/thesis_phd.pdf) in December 2015, under the supervision of [Alberto Canonaco](http://www-dimat.unipv.it/canonaco/).

I am an alumnus of [Collegio Fratelli Cairoli](https://www.collegiocairoli.it/).

## Research interests
- Triangulated categories and their higher categorical enhancements: differential graded categories, A-infinity categories.
- t-structures on triangulated categories and their enhancements.
- Applications of higher categories to algebraic geometry: derived categories, Fourier-Mukai functors.
