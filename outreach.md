### Youtube channel

I have a personal [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FrancescoGenovese) on which I uploaded a few videos. In particular, you can find the following playlists:

- [Linear Algebra Exercises](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A-ORhYpumzEIooXGzr6wAFdhoddemK4). Exercises in Linear Algebra that I prepared for the eponymous course in the Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp in 2020/2021. The exercises are completely worked through, also with explanations on how to write clean solutions.
- [L'impalcatura dello spazio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A-ORhYpumwJrOLiMldZVsdwcSAcFdbd) (Italian). Recorded live sessions on selected topics in Algebraic Topology. I've attempted to make them accessible to a wide public of scholars (not only mathematicians) while maintaining a suitable level of rigor.

### Meet Science (Italian)

A few colleagues from various scientific areas and I have started an outreach project with the goal of interviewing Italian scientists and academics, and helping spread and communicate their activities to the general public.
