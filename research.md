### Overview

My work is centered on *homological algebra*, which is essentially the study of "linearized scaffolds of spaces": [chain complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_complex), (co)homology and so on. In some sense, homological algebra is "higher dimensional linear algebra". I'm mostly interested in the theory and applications of *differential graded (=dg) categories*, which are categories whose hom-sets are themselves chain complexes. Dg-categories are, in fact, part of the world of higher categories, and they serve as enhancements for *triangulated categories* - a common tool in contemporary algebra and algebraic geometry.

*Caveat*: PDF files uploaded here are often more up-to-date than the arXiv versions.
