My work is centered on *homological algebra*, which is essentially the study of "linearized scaffolds of spaces": [chain complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_complex), (co)homology and so on. I'm mostly interested in the theory and applications of *differential graded (=dg) categories*, which are categories whose hom-sets are themselves chain complexes. Dg-categories are, in fact, part of the world of higher categories, and they serve as enhancements for *triangulated categories* - a common tool in contemporary algebra and algebraic geometry.

- [The uniqueness problem of dg-lifts and Fourierâ€“Mukai kernels](https://academic.oup.com/jlms/article-abstract/94/2/617/2219049), *Journal of the London Mathematical Society*, 2016 ([PDF](https://fgenovese1987.github.io/documents/papers/dglift_uniqueness.pdf))
